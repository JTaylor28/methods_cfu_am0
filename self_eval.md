# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods? 
*   Honestly, not great..
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
* as it stands, pretty uncomfortable
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
* the best way I can word this is, I just don't understand the logic and all together need more time on it.
